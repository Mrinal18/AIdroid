Tensorflow Folder:

It includes two programs, one using cnn and the other using regular regular perceptron model. 
I used the MNIST dataset because it was easily accessible. Now that I have made the model
I have to find a suitable dataset and then apply the model on that dataset for optimal results. 
The cnn model gives more accuracy on the same dataset than the regular perceptron model. 
I have included the mnist dataset within.

tf_files: 

This folder contains the program for image classification using the tensoflow for poets library. 
It uses a model called the imagenet3 model which is a model which was built after training on nearly 5 million pictures. 
We are doing a process called retraining where we use a pre-existing model and further train that model using our own dataset(a set of pictures of flowers).
It is supposed to be ran off a container from docker.

I will apply the cnn model on a suitable dataset and submit results, as soon as i find one.
